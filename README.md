## Introduction
I am a 2024-2025 AP CSA student who has just completed the course and the exam. With the knowledge I gained, I plan to create a tower defense game. Originally, I intended to develop this project using P5.js, but halfway through, I realized that for a project of this scale, I should use the language I am most familiar with: Java. This game will be coded in Pickcode using Java Processing.

I was motivated to take on this project because I love playing tower defense games and want to create my own version. Previously, I made a tower defense game in Roblox Lua by following a tutorial and mostly copying its content. This time, I want to build my own version using the experience I’ve gained from watching tutorials and CSA. I will document every step of my development process on GitHub, providing a step-by-step guide on how I created this game.


## After the Project
There were many skills I gained, while making this project. I learn that using folders are important, while making these projects because it keeps your project organize. Similar things should be group together like every character should be inside a characters folder and every enemy should be inside a enemies folder. In this project, I was also able to use/expand the skills I gained from CSA and not let it be wasted/forgotten. In many other classes I took, such as biology, chemistry, and physic many of the things I learned from those class, I have either forgotten about or I have no use of them at all.
