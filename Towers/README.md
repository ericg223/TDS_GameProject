## Tower
### Summary

To create a tower defense game, we need characters (or towers) that can attack enemies. I designed my own sprites using reference images and Piskel App. My goal for this project is to implement six unique towers to defend the base. Each tower will have its own custom sprite and a distinct attack mechanic.

## Roadmap
| Done | Task |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| ❌ | Cannon (Damage enemy)|
| ❌ | Freezer (Apply cold effect to enemy and make them walk slower)|
| ❌ | Laser Cannon (Stronger cannon)|
| ❌ | DJ (Play music and buff nearby towers)|
| ❌ | Farm (Give money every wave)|
| ❌ | Medic (Heal your base)|

## Challenges
- After making a few sprites, I realize that while making sprites resolution and pixels matters. I had to redo some models to make sure it has the right amount of pixels.
